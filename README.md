# Bear2Blog
A Python script called bear2blog.py is used to automate transfer my blog notes written on [Bear](bear.app) to blog posts on my webpage.
- Put the script into the root folder of the static website
- Usage: `python3 bear2blog.py [note identifier]`
- Supports texts and pictures
- Removes the first two lines of the Bear note (my personal preference, the first line is the title and the second line I usually includes Bear tags)
